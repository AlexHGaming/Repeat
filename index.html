<h2>Note</h2>

<p>I am currently making this site at 7AM BST, so I will need to go to school sometime soon, so this website won't be like it will be tonight.</p>

<h2>Is this a virus?</h2>

<p>Obviously not, so don't think for 50 hours whether if it is safe. If you are still curious, use your anti-virus.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Click the "Download Repeat" button, then extract your zip file to your desktop. Open the extracted folder, then run Repeat.exe.</p>

<br>

<center><button type = "button" onclick = "download()" class = "btn btn-primary btn-lg">Download Repeat</button></center>

<script>

function download() {
window.location.href = "./Repeat.zip"
}
