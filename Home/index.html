<h2>What is Repeat?</h2>

<p>Repeat is a "dodge the obstacle" style type game, written in C#, using the <a href = "https://unity3d.com" target="_blank">Unity Engine</a>. 
Currently, Repeat goes up to 1000 points, then the game is over. Don't panic, the game is currently in version 1.0, we will have updates to come up.
</p>

<h2>How do you play?</h2>

<p>Your cube sticks to the ground and you automatically move; you can't go quicker or slower in terms of speed. You hold A to move to the left, and D to move to the right.
Don't hit the black obstacles, don't fall off the map, you win!
</p>

<h2>Is this a virus?</h2>

<p>Obviously not, so don't think for 50 hours whether if it is safe. If you are still curious, use your anti-virus.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Click the "Download Repeat" button, then extract your zip file to your desktop. Open the extracted folder, then run Repeat.exe.</p>
